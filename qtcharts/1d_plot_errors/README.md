1D Plot With Errors & NaN Values
--------------------------------

Most basic plot type showing data points with NaN signal values and error bars.


Issues:

* It is actually a box plot as adding to the standard scatter plot behaviour
is not trivial. This means that the ticks don't line up with the data!
* You can't have this type of plot with a connected lines or custom markers
